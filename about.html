            </div>
            <img src="assets/jakarta.png" alt="jakarta">
          <p style="text-indent:25px;"> I've lived overseas for about 11 years of my life. My parents worked in oil and gas
            and I've had the amazing opportunity to travel all across the world, living in more than 7 countries across 4 continents.
          I'm ethnically Indian, but was born in Dubai while my parents worked there. After about a year in Dubai, we moved
        to Balikpapan, Indonesia and then to Jakarta, Indonesia, staying in the country for about 3 years total.</p>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">After that, we moved to Paris, France for ~2 years total before moving to Bangkok, Thailand for another 2 years.
        Then came another big move, this time to Africa where we were based in Kharthoum, Sudan from 2011-2013, before the split of Sudan.
        After that, we were back in Asia, this time in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Though after that we moved to Houston, Texas where I've been since, coming up on 7 years.
        Much of my elementary and middle school years were in Asia/Africa/Europe where I was exposed to a multitude of cultures/peoples that have all given me a very unique
      and global perspective. I'm glad for the travels I've had and also very grateful to now settle down in the US. </p>

      <p> I'm now a Computer Science student at Texas A&M and am eager to learn about and work in Tech. I'm hardworking, driven, and a great communicator that's always looking to improve.</p>
