      <p class = "text">I love being involved in various service projects. Here are a few that I'm passionate about:</p>
      <h2>American Red Cross</h2>
      <p>I've been volunteering for the Red Cross since high school. I was originally involved in their Hurricane Harvey Disaster Relief and Aid outreach.
        More recently, I'm working on setting up a blood drive between them and Texas A&M.
      </p>
      <h2>Lone Survivor Foundation</h2>
      <p>The Lone Survivor Foundation (LSF) is an organization with the mission of providing veterans and their families with a path to heal from their invisible wounds.
        Insivible wounds are ones that are not from physical combat, but from the PTSD and mental health effects that veterans have after active service. I was a memeber of LSF's chapter
        at TAMU in my freshman year. We did a number of awareness and profit shares. For example, we had "flag day" where we put hundreds of flags in central campus for veteran's mental health awareness.
        Additionally, we parterned with local businesses in profit shares that donate to the parent LSF organization that helps provide veterans with resources.
